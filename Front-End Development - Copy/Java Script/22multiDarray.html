    <pre>What is a Multidimensional Array?
A multidimensional array is simply an array of arrays.

Think of a regular (one-dimensional) array as a single list of items.

["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"] // 1D Array - a single row


A two-dimensional (2D) array is like a grid or a table, with rows and columns. Each 
element in the main array is itself another array, representing a row. The elements 
inside those inner arrays represent the columns.

[
  ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"],  // Row 0
  ["Carrot", "Lettuce", "Broccoli"], // Row 1
  ["Chocolate", "Vanilla", "Strawberry"] // Row 2
]

Row 0, Column 0: "Apple"

Row 1, Column 2: "Broccoli"

Row 2, Column 1: "Vanilla"

You can have arrays with more than two dimensions (3D, 4D, etc.). 
A 3D array is an array of 2D arrays, which you can visualize as a cube of data or 
multiple tables stacked on top of each other. However, 2D arrays are by far the most 
common in practice.
