    <h1>Event loop in Java Script</h1>

    <p>JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes one thing at a time. But still, it can handle asynchronous
        tasks (like setTimeout, API calls, promises, etc.) without blocking</p>
    <h2>How it works.</h2>
    <p>1.<b>Call Stacks</b> - Js executes code line by line here.</p>
    <p>2.<b>Web APIs (Browser APIs)</b> - When we use function like <b>setTimeout, fetch</b>, etc., the browser takes
        care of them separately.</p>
    <p>3.<b>Callback Queue (Task Queue / Message Queue) </b>- When the browser finishes those async tasks, their
        <b>callbacks</b> are placed in the queue.
    </p>

    <p>4.<b>Event Loop</b> - Constantly checks: <br>i."Is the call stack is empty?" <br> ii. If yes, it pushes the
        <b>first callback from the queue</b> into the call stack. </p>

    <h1>CallBack Queue.</h1>
    <pre>    It stores callbacks waiting to be executed after async tasks complete.

    Example: setTimeout, setInterval, DOM events, etc.

    The event loop takes these one by one and puts them on the call stack to run.</pre>
