        <h1>How to See Variable Address in Dev Tools?</h1>
        <p>The key thing to understand is that cannot directly see the memory address (like 0x1045a83c2) in the way
            might in
            a lower-level language like C++. Instead, inspect the reference, which is what the variable holds for
            objects
            and arrays.</p>

        <p>In short, We can't see the memory address as a raw number (like 0x1045a83c2).</p>
