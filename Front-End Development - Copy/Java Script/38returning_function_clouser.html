    <h1>Returning Functions with Closures.</h1>
    <h2>What is clouser?</h2>
    <p>A closure is formed when a function “remembers” the variables from its lexical scope (the scope in which it was
        created), even after that scope has finished executing.</p>
    <p>A closure allows an inner function to access variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has
        returned.</p>

    <h2>Returning function with clousers</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, instead of just executing a function, we return another function from inside it.
That returned function keeps a reference to the variables of the outer function → this is where closures come into play.</p>
