    <h1>Lexical and Block Scope in JS.</h1>

    <h2>1. Lexical Scope in JavaScript</h2>
    <pre style="font-size: 20px;">>   Definition: Lexical scope (also called static scope) means that the scope of a variable
    is determined by where it is written in the code, not where it is called from.

>   Inner functions can access variables defined in their outer functions because of lexical
    scope.</pre>

    <h2>2. Block Scope in JavaScript</h2>
    <pre style="font-size: 20px;">>   Definition: Block scope means that variables declared with 
    let or const are only accessible inside the block { } in which they are defined.

>   var does not follow block scope (it is function-scoped).</pre>
