    <h2>1. What is a Higher Order Function?</h2>
    <pre style="font-size: 17px;">> A Higher Order Function (HOF) is a function that does one or both of the following:

1.Takes another function as an argument (callback)

2.Returns a function

This makes functions in JavaScript first-class citizens (they can be passed around just like values).</pre>

    <h2>2.What is callback?</h2>
    <pre
        style="font-size: 17px;">A callback is simply a function passed as an argument to another function, which is later called back inside that function. </pre>
