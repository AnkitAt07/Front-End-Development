    <h3>1. What is an Object?</h3>
    <p>
        An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs. It's a fundamental data type used to store various
        properties and methods (functions) under a single name. Think of it like a real-world object; for example, a car
        can have properties like color, model, and weight, and methods like start() and stop().</p>
