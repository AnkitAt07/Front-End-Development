    <h2>Functions?</h2>
    <p>A function is a block of reausable code that performs a specific tasks.It can be decleared independently and is not tied to any object.</p>

    <h2>Methods?</h2>
    <p>A method is a function that belongs to an object.
If you define a function inside an object as a property, it becomes a method.</p>

<p>All methods are functions.</p>
