    <h1>Truthy And Fasly in Js.</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. A falsy
        value is a value that is considered false in a Boolean context.</p>
    <h2>Falsy Value in JS.</h2>
    <pre><h3>There are only 8 falsy values in JavaScript. You should memorize them. Everything else is truthy.</h3>

false (The boolean false itself)

0 (The number zero)

-0 (Negative zero)

0n (BigInt zero)

"" (Empty string - single or double quotes)

null (The absence of any value)

undefined (A variable that has not been assigned a value)

NaN (Not a Number)</pre>

    <h2>Truthy Value in JS.</h2>
    <pre><h3>Common Truthy Values</h3>
Since everything not on the falsy list is truthy, the list is endless. Here are the most common and sometimes surprising ones:

true (The boolean true)

"hello" (Any non-empty string, including "false" and "0")

42 (Any non-zero number, including negative ones, e.g., -1)

Infinity and -Infinity

[] (An empty array - this is a big one!)

{} (An empty object - this is another big one!)

function() {} (An empty function)

Dates, Regexes, etc.</pre>
