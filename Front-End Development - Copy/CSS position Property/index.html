        The CSS position property specifies how an element is positioned in a document. It's fundamental
        for controlling
        layout and element placement.

        <pre>1.Static (default):
    Element flows normally in the document.
    Ignores top, bottom, left, right, and z-index properties.</pre>

        <pre>2.relative
    Positioned relative to its normal position.
    Can use top, bottom, left, right to offset it.
    Doesn't remove element from normal document flow.</pre>

        <pre>3.absolute
    Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
    If no positioned ancestor, uses document body.
    Removed from normal document flow.</pre>
        <pre>4.fixed.
    Positioned relative to viewport.
    Stays in same place when scrolling.
    Removed from normal document flow.</pre>

        <pre>5.sticky (hybrid of relative and fixed).
    Treated as relative until crossing a threshold.
    Then becomes fixed at specified position.
    Requires at least one positioning property (top, bottom, etc.)</pre>
