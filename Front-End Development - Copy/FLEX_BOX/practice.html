        <pre>    Justifying Content in CSS
    The justify-content property in CSS is used to align and distribute space between flex items along the main axis of their flex container. It's a key property for controlling layout in Flexbox.

    Basic Syntax
    css
    .container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: value;
    }
    Common Values
    flex-start (default)

    Items are packed toward the start of the flex direction

    css
    justify-content: flex-start;
    flex-end

    Items are packed toward the end of the flex direction

    css
    justify-content: flex-end;
    center

    Items are centered along the line

    css
    justify-content: center;
    space-between

    Items are evenly distributed with equal space between them

    First item at start, last item at end

    css
    justify-content: space-between;
    space-around

    Items evenly distributed with equal space around them

    css
    justify-content: space-around;
    space-evenly

    Items distributed with equal space around and between them

    Notes
    justify-content only works when there is extra space in the container

    It affects items along the main axis (horizontal by default)

    For alignment along the cross axis (vertical by default), use align-items

    In Grid layout, justify-content works similarly but affects the entire grid along the inline (row) axis
