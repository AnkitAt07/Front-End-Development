    <pre>Flexbox in CSS
Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model that allows you to design flexible and efficient layouts with items that can dynamically adjust their size and position to best fill the available space. It's particularly useful for creating responsive designs without using floats or positioning.

Key Features of Flexbox:
One-dimensional layout (either row or column)

Items can grow or shrink to fill available space

Easy alignment and distribution of space

Simple reordering of elements regardless of DOM order

Flexbox Types (Container and Items)
Flexbox actually consists of two components:

1. Flex Container
The parent element that holds flex items. You create a flex container by setting display: flex or display: inline-flex.

Main properties for flex containers:

flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse

flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse

justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly

align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline

align-content: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around

2. Flex Items
The children of a flex container. Each direct child becomes a flex item.

Main properties for flex items:

order: integer (default 0)

flex-grow: number (default 0)

flex-shrink: number (default 1)

flex-basis: length | auto (default auto)

align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch</pre>
